# lothus-app
Lothus - trip planning app

# Description
Lothus is a simple trip & travel planning app, build for educational purposes. As I've worked mostly on on-premise apps in the past, I wanted to work more with the Cloud and Azure services to get some deeper insight and know-how.

# Project goals

Apart from an obvious goal of building a complete working app, which I could use for my own needs, I wanted to set up some things that I want to accomplish while coding this project. These are some tools/directions that I want to explore. 

- [ ] Go for Domain-Driven-Design and focus on the domain
- [ ] Dockerize the app and set up complete CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps
- [ ] Use VS Code to built the app instead of Visual Studio. I just wanted to code more with light-weight IDE
- [ ] Use new ASP.NET Core Minimal API
- [ ] Make use of OpenAI APIs
- [ ] Use Azure NoSQL CosmosDb


This list might fluctuate and I might add some points later, as my vision will probably change in time.
